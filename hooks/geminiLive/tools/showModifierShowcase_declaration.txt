// showModifierShowcase - Tool for AI to showcase all modifiers
{
  name: "showModifierShowcase",
  description: `
Smoothly auto-scroll through all available modifiers to show the user all options.
Use this ONLY when:
1) Modifier screen is currently active
2) User asks to see all options ("show me all", "what toppings do you have?", "let me see everything")
3) There are many modifiers and user might benefit from seeing them all

DO NOT use randomly or without user request. This should enhance the experience, not interrupt it.

After calling this, wait 3-4 seconds for scroll to complete, then say something like:
"That's all the options! Tell me what you'd like and I'll add them for you."

  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {},
  },
},
